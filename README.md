# KZX Engine
## Description
KZX Engine is an 3D  game engine under a proprietary based license, the KZX Engine was inspired by the gaming industry standards, created by [Grand Dog Studio](https://www.granddogstudio.com/). KZX Engine is now currently a Closed-sourced 3D Engine due to copythefts, but that could eventually change, if we were to become open source, then this repository would be open to any contributions.

KZX Engine was based around these key functions:
- User Interface
- Easy-To-Use
- Documentation
- Usable for educational students & professionals
- Modularity.
