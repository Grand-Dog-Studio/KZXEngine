# 1. What is KZX Engine
## 1.1. Description
KZX Engine is an 3D video game engine under a proprietary based license this engine was made soley in C++ and extensive libraries, the KZX Engine was inspired by the popular gaming industry engines such as "Unity" or "Unreal Engine", created by [Grand Dog Studio](https://www.granddogstudio.com/). The KZX Engine is now currently a Closed-sourced 3D game engine due to copythefts that happened in the past. But that could eventually change, if we would become open source then this current repository would be open to any contribution from the community.

KZX Engine was based around these key functions:
- User Interface.
- Easy-To-Use.
- Effective Documentation
- Usable for educational students & professionals.
- Rewarding using certification program.
- Modularity.

# 2. History of KZX Engine
## 2.1. About KZX Engine
KZX Engine was officially founded in 2014 by a small software developer named Sander Kerkhoff he also started his own organization during that period which he named "Grand Dog Studio". With a small team of 4 creators, KZX Engine became a facinating program that has won a few bussines and technology awards for their profounding software, the initial engine was made using dependancies for a better workflow for making games. The engine is still under heavy construction after all these years. The engine was originally intended for open-source uses, the engine got copythefted and got cloned by multiple people. KZX Engine is to this day still a hardworking project with developers with great passion for software.
